## Prompt Guide Takeaways

From the Stitch Prompt Guide (https://discuss.ai.google.dev/t/stitch-prompt-guide/83844):

### Key Recommendations:
1. **Iterative approach**: Make 1-2 changes per prompt, not multiple at once
2. **Be specific**: Use precise UI terminology ("call-to-action button", "navigation bar", "hero section")
3. **Start broad or specific**: Depending on complexity
4. **Save iterations**: Screenshot successful designs before making more changes
5. **Use descriptive adjectives**: "A minimalist and focused app" or "warm and friendly beauty app"

### For Our App:
- Start with: "A warm and friendly beauty app for skin tone analysis"
- Be specific about changes: "Make the primary button forest green"
- Reference elements precisely: "The capture button on the camera screen"

## Next Steps

1. Visit Stitch website and explore documentation
2. Fill in the sections above with specific guidelines
3. Create mood board / design inspiration
4. Start designing mockups following Stitch principles
5. Document component choices and rationale
